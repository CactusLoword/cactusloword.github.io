The epic trilogy, with me reviewing the music and universe of Irodorimidori, an anime girl band.
I also expanded the trilogy into a full story, with me reviewing the newly-released songs.

To clarify, I have another story on Irodorimidori, but that one is specifically about the anime, whereas this is music-based.

If you are interested in listening to this music in an organised manner, here is channel with many playlists, arranged by player and band:
