Today is an extremely special episode. I planned this week's ago, but could only do it now, due to the events being very suggestive. Before, I was also worried, as the pear that conceded with the day was smaller than I hoped. However, I made it work. Anyway, you are probably wondering what I did. All will be revealed later, but I can say that it rhymes with meshkite.



This pear was given to me yesterday (Weds), at period 3. As soon as I got it, I knew what fate would befall it. As mentioned in the intro, I was slightly concerned, as it was smaller than anticipated. However, as I later noticed, the girth was just right.



As soon as I woke up, I raced out of bed, my veins coursing with excitement. Ok, maybe not. In actuality I tried to get back to sleep, then got up and ready and had my breakfast, as I was hungry. My breakfast was a special flavour of shreddies (subtle foreshadow for some time in the future), during which I watched Saiki K (foreshadow, but not about me). After that, I was ready to begin my procedure. With this being a Thursday morning, it was the perfect time. This is probably the most time to myself, which is useful as this probably isn't something I should do whilst my family were home, to avoid any concerned questions. Unfortunately, I had less time than I usually have on Thurs morn, as I had assembly to go to. Despite this, I estimated that I would have plenty of time, so set out the pear on a plate, got a knife, and set down my equipment at the table.

At this point you are probably very curious. You're sitting on the edge of your seat.  "What is this mysterious event which you have been teasing us with?", you ask. Well, the secret will now be revealed. I was building a fleshlight. Yes, I know, it is an incredible idea. You are probably crying rn, although it would depend on the person on whether they were tears of joy or terror.

However, as I previously mentioned, this pear wouldn't be the most preferable candidate due to its size. In a fleshlight, one aspect you would likely not even look for because it would be expected, is that it is actually long enough. Without trying to shame the pear (or anyone else), with this pear being 748km in length top-to-butt, it is below average length of a schlong. A fleshlight would be even longer than this, so this length is not acceptable. Also, you need to take into account that as this pear is pear-shaped, so the top end is thinner. This means that you have even less usable space, maybe around 573km as an approximation, which is honestly just a rip-off. Just imagine the pear sitting on your dick, with a chunk of the schaft sticking out. Whilst that is a hilarious thought, it is also a bit sad. Actually no, it would be even funnier if the pear fit the penis, and then it would just look like you had a pear for a dick. Just fantasising about it is side-splitting. Now I kind of want to try it, to see how funny it would be. If that picture doesn't exist I will be disappointed. 

Ok, I'm partly disappointed. I first found some pears shaped like cocks, which were quite amusing, but then after disabling the automatically incognito-enabled default safesearch, there was no pears to be found. Tasumaki from One Punch Man appeared for 2 searches interestingly, but in the wall of skin on my screen not a single pear could be identified. On one of the searches there was also so much mlp porn, and also a blursed image of sonic, which did actually involve a pear, although it wasn't as dirty as you think. I then found myself on a video which I can't remember why I clicked on (I guess it was out of curiosity), but I hate the video and myself and the degeneracy and don't want to talk about it. Tbh I thought I had quite a high tolerance for incel sexual behaviour, but that crossed a line I didn't know was there. Ok that makes it sound illegal and really worse than it actually was, so I'm just going to say it involved one man, and you can probably get the gist of what happened. Although afterwards I think I actually learned something about myself, which was unexpected, so I am glad for this experience. This is even relevant to the assembly we had (about gratitude) after I had the pear, which is intriguing. 

Nooo why am I still looking at this, I just saw another video involving just another man, and again I hate it, although it's better than the last one. I think I've just gone and learned another thing about myself, about my tolerance of stuff, as I think it's quite interesting how I despised the first one, but wasn't horribly bothered by the second one.



Nevertheless, with my ingenuity, I devised a notion, which is worth of a Noble prize. This would allow the pear to not feel left out of , and my creation could still be made. I'm also very proud of the name. This would be the First Flaccid Fleshlight. Told you it was good. Just don't ask me the technicalities of how that would work. So after my plan had been realised, I began work. With the knife I cut a deep circle in the bottom, and cut out the big chunky inside. I then sculpted the inside out a bit more, to enlarge and advance it. Before long, I was done. It wasn't an especially hard task, and I was happy with the result. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention before but I DID NOT USE THIS DEVICE. IT WAS OUT OF CURIOSITY ONLY, THERE WAS NO HORNINESS INVOLVED. Ok, here's some pics. ðŸ˜‰

Well I hope you enjoyed that, but the story isn't over. I decided to keep on digging, to perfect my craft. However, you know what they say about art (If it's finished, it's finished, or don't overdo it, or something like that), and at one side, it was getting quite weak, and the skin was soon to breaking. This was due to over-digging, so it would no longer be suitable for its previous use, unless the hole was used as a plughole, which would've been a good idea. However, I had started to get new ideas, and after making the hole in the end, I was committed to the new cause.

I then dug another hole in the top, to make my creation. At this point, you may have some suspicions of what it is. Incase you are still unsure, here's a picture, as a last hint:

I have turned a fleshlight into an instrument. After all my preparation, it had all led to this moment. I parsed my lips to the upper hole, and blew a tune.
Ok so of course it wouldn't've worked properly, it's a pear. It wasn't too bad though, it did play a very gentle tune, but it's less than equal to blowing through a tube. I did record audio, but I'm not sure how to share it.

After some playing around, it was time to consume my creation. It was inevitable, but it was still sad to see it go. It was quite a unique eating experience, as eating something with a hole in it is like eating an ice cream cone. It was like eating a tall long fruity doughnut.

Overall, I enjoyed that morning. It is also quite funny to realise that I achieved that much before school, when on a weekend I barely get one task done. I am very proud of this event, which will be remembered for a millennia.
