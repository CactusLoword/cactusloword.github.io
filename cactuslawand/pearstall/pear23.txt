Ok, fine, you can tell me off for not reviewing every pear, but it takes time and effort, which sometimes I don't want to put in. Regardless, I am writing this weeks after I ate the pears, so trying to describe them would be futile. Luckily I took pictures though, so I'll include those, with some mini descriptions

Had a significant curved shape, unique and fun in that way
