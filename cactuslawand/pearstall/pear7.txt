I apologise for not sending in this assignment earlier, but I just haven't got round to doing it. I mean I left it on my desk/ lost it/ we ran out of toilet paper. However, now, I am currently writing this, so it is better late than never.

This pear is one I ate on Friday 15th October 2021. It was break time, and with the pear being in my bag, I thought I should eat it now. Not only would it help nullify my hunger, but I also needed to eat it sooner or later, so then seemed like a good time. Moreover, for more information about the arrival of this pear in my bag, please refer to the last review. I'll give you some time. Ok, you're back? So basically in conclusion, I got it on Weds before my chem lesson, just before I ate the previous pear. In addition, I also received an unexpected pear on Thurs, which will have to wait.

Then, as my usual routine goes, I removed the stalk, and then readied myself to begin. For my last pear, you may recall that I ate it upside from usual. As I mentioned there, the experience wasn't unpleasant, but it also wasn't very pleasant, so I wasn't to eager to eat it like that again too soon (not that the taste was changed from the different position, it was still delectable).

Before I ate, I did a little bit of a pear photoshoot. These private pictures are available below:

I then began to eat it from top. The pear was less juicy than the last few, but it was still quite succulent. There was a bit of a chunky bit in the middle, but overall, very nice.

I think I've got more experienced with eating pears, as I managed to finish this one off in under 4 minutes. I might time a future one, as it could prove interesting. I also have further plans on unique ways to eat a pear, which could spice things up a bit, but that won't be for some time. For now at least I still need to consume the last pear of this half-term, which does seriously need to be eaten soon. Actually, I might have it now.
Happy Pearsworth!
