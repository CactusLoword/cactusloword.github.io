After eating so many pears, I have realised I could become a pear champion. Even though reviewing and eating a large quantity of them does give me a higher status, I feel like I'm at the stage where I could start competing with myself, with the pears. One such competition could be a speedrun, which I completed today.

I first got the idea of doing a pear speedrun when I ate my latest pear at school (pear 7), when I ate the pear very fast. This was my inspiration. I received this pear on Monday 1st November 2021, and at lunchtime today, I thought it would be a great time to eat and time it. I also was gifted another pear on Tuesday, so it would be best to eat one as soon as, or else risk having a backlog of pears, which probably wouldn't end up too great. I equipped the pear in my hand, and prepared the timer on my phone.

My end score was 1 min 52 secs.

I scrammed that pear faster than a snake deep-throating a larger animal. I'm quite happy with my score, especially for the first timed session. Under 2 mins is pretty good, and is what I was aiming for. Today's snack was also harder to eat than I anticipated, as it was extremely juicy, so juicy that it squirted all over my hand and the floor. It just wouldn't stop splurging, even until the last bite. Whilst this did make for a tasty meal, it didn't help my speedrun, in fact it hindered it. I guess there is a bit of luck with this speedrun, as too wet will just get everywhere, and too dry will suck out all my moisture, making it much harder to swallow. I guess I can just hope that next time I will get good RNG.

There we go, that was my speedrun. One thing I'm not sure about is what to call it, as it isn't any%, as I could just take a bite and be done, but it also isn't technically 100%, as I'm not eating the stalk. Maybe we can call it the 100% Stalkless Pear Speedrun. Perhaps one day I could do the True 100% Pear Speedrun, but eating what I think might be wood probably won't be too good. With water it'll be fine though.
