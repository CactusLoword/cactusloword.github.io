Wow, receiving this pear sure was a gift. At first sight I knew I would be in for great time. What separated this pear from the rest was this: it was abnormally large. Not only that, but it was also not pear shaped. It was almost like it was made to look phallic.

Despite this amazement, I took it for granted. I know I should eat them when I get them, but I just end up not. Even worse than that is that I forgot it was in my bag. This meant that when I went to eat the pear, I found it underneath my bottle. This was a bit of an issue, as it was a bit squishy. There was also a slit on the side, which had created a pretty sizable bruise.

However, that would not deter me. Or at least, it would only deter me a bit. I thought it would be a waste to dispose of, especially after Sam graciously bestowed it upon me. Subsequently, I cut the bad things off, and ate the pear. I think it was quite a nice pear.
