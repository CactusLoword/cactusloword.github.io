ðŸŽ‰Happy 10th Pear!ðŸŽ‰ We've reached dual figures! I didn't do anything to commemorate this event, but it is truly a moment to celebrate, I just don't have any ideas. This was my second speedrun (100% Stalkless Pear), and I am happy to note that I have improved at my oral skills.

I got this pear on Tuesday 2nd Nov 2021, this pear was delivered to me not via the Great Pearman himself, which was a surprise. After recieving it, I promptly went to consult Sam, just out of interest. He was seated in the LRC, engrossed in work. The events were cleared up for me, as I guess he was just being lazy. There was also another problem in it, which was a part of the pear where the skin had been peeled slightly, which I desired more information on. You should be careful of where objects have been before inserting them into your mouth. As it turned out, it was just damaged in transit in an enclosed bag, so I was ok with that.

Today, on Weds, I received yet another pear. As I had time to spare, due to me completing all my homework, I thought it could be nice to eat this pear. As it was in school, that is also the most convenient place to hold a speedrun, so I set my timer, removed the stalk, and prepared to eat. I was slightly apprehensive to start with, as I was in a bit of a public place, with people I know, and the end of this pear was very phallic. Despite this, I took a deep breath, and plunged the fruit into my mouth.

The first half of the pear was easier to eat, due to it having less mass and surface area. I probably ate that bit in 20 seconds, which did give me false hope, as the base has more sustenance so is harder and takes longer to eat. This pear was also more suitable for a speedrun, as the juicy:dry ratio was approx right. Perhaps it was a little less juicy then that would be perfect, but it was very manageable. One thing I also want to clarify is that this was a normal sized pear, and not a small one. I just wanted to say that as due to pears varying greatly in size, it would be hard to have standardised pear dimensions. However, as it's just me, I will just have to be honest to myself, and not cheat. I think I can generally trust myself.

I've also developed a good method for eating quickly. The skin is the hardest but to break down, but if you take care to manually chomp down the food quickly, then it would significantly improve the time, rather than taking your time. Starting from the top also seems to be going well for me.

My final time was 1:38. This was an improvement of 14 seconds, which is quite good, and I'm happy with. Earlier though I did announce that it was 22 seconds difference, which I'm not proud of, as I'm not sure what happened with my mental maths there. There is always room for improvement though, and I hope that by the end of this year, I will be able to swallow a pear whole.
