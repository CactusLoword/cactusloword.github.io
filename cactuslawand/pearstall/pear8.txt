This is the last pear of this half term. It has been a wild ride, but for now I will have to survive the lack of pears in my system. From this, it seems I have decided to not eat the pear yet, which hasn't gone too well so far.

I got this pear on Thursday, which was quite the surprise. Thursday is the day where I'm only in for 3 lessons, so I'm at home more than I'm at school. Despite this, a pear still found its way to me, which I'm not complaining about. However, I waited to eat it, as I still had one to eat, which then meant that I didn't get round to eating it until Sunday. I did plan on eating it on Saturday, but I guess I ended up not, also I thought I should finish the review for the last one before I ate the next. I then put the pear in my bag on Saturday, to keep it secure to eat in the future.

Unfortunately, the pear wasn't safe. As it occurs, there was an object resting on top of the pear, which left a large gash the base. This gave me a shocking shock, as the once pristene pear was now quite damaged, which also slightly damaged the appeal of it. Despite this, I was still determined to engulf it with my mouth, as not only would it be a waste, and a waste of Sam's pear, but also I still wanted to eat it, despite its injury. I then put it in the fridge to have later.

Eventually on Sunday night, I decided it was high time for the pear sitting in the fridge to be eaten. I removed it from its glass bed, and placed in on a small plate, which would be its final resting place. I also had some hot chocolate to accompany it which was kindly constructed for me, so it was like a proper nearly midnight snack. This would also serve as somewhat of a experiment; does chocolate go with pear?

I mean, not really. It doesn't taste horrible, but I understand why you don't see any Pear Chocolate bars.
As they don't go too well together, I chose to eat the pear first. However, I was unsure of whether to cut out the gash, or just eat it. As I was still deciding, I ate the bottom of the pear, to eat around the intense damage.  Although I tried to avoid it, I ended up eating the side of the slash, so I thought it wouldn't make a difference if I just ate the whole pear.
However, this pear-eating-experience wasn't too great. The pear was quite juicy, which was probably helped from being squished, and I'm sure it was actually nice, but I have to come clean. I must confess something. I was Based. Yes, I know, it is a hanus crime. I just couldn't enjoy it properly when I knew that the biological security seal of the pear had been broken. After every mouthful I was reminded of the broken skin of the pear, signifying the now unfreshness of the pear. Of course, I admit that it was completely my fault, as pears apparently don't make very good tables. However, my negligence has cost me a delicious pear. What before I would've imagined as a last great taste, is now tainted. Now I just think of that gap smiling on me, as I ate it's body. It truly was a sad day.

Whilst it is unfortunate that the last pear for some time wasn't the best, I won't let that affect my overall view of pears. Anyway, this hiatus might be good, as too much of a good thing is bad. Although if one thing's for sure, these pear-saturated weeks have been nice. Before I end, I want to extend a thank you to Sam P, for his nearly endless supply of pears he has been bestowing upon me. None of this would've been possible without him. And also thanks to his pear supplier, whoever that may be. *Clapclapclapclapclap*.

However, I would like to take some time to say something. Whilst me being given these pears has been a blessing, and I have enjoyed receiving them all, I do realise that these pears haven't appeared out of thin air. A pear given to me, is one taken from Sam. Please do not feel any obligation to donate your pears. I encourage you to eat them, as the saying goes: a pear a day keeps the Hare away, and as we all know full well that we don't want the pear-eating Hare ransacking the neighbourhood again. However, if you do have a pear which you don't want to eat, I will always be there , with my jaw ready to clamp down on that sweet pear.
