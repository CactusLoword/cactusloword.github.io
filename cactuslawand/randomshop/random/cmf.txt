Today I shall be reviewing a Lego cmf, which I picked up today. At the start of the day, I didn't expect to have bought some Lego, but it turns out I have. I did plan on buying some of the minifigs though in the future, so how this day has worked out is beneficial to me. Intro over, the review will begin shortly.


It was after the Chemistry lesson, and I didn't have any lessons left. Similar to last week, it seemed my buddies were heading in a Tesco-ward direction, so I decided to join them. I didn't think I would end up buying anything, but as is evident, I apparently did. After the perilous journey, we were browsing the meal deal and magazine aisle. I saw a great deal for 3 Cadbury's Caramilk chocolate bars (the smaller ones) for £1.20, which was a deal I couldn't refuse. Also, as I sit here, I realise that the overall cost was £5.30, and with a minifig costing £3.50 and the chocolate £1.20, equating to £4.70, I have been scammed by Tesco personally out of 60p. With the Caramilk bars being 60p, it seems there was an issue with those. It is possible I accidentally scanned one twice, but with the self serve tills you have to practically slam the item down on the side to mark it as "In you bag". My guess is that the offer for whatever reason didn't get flagged by the system, which means I didn't get my 60p off, which is unfortunate.

Ok back to things being in chronological order, after that discovery and outrage just then. After getting my chocolate bars, I elected to go up to the toy section, to take a peek at the Lego. It was unlikely there would be any offers, as there usually aren't any in Tesco, unless it is a set that's about to be retired. I did see the Lego Vidiyo cmf series in the clearance section, but due to there not being a price label, I restrained myself. When I arrived at the Lego section, it was more or less what I've seen before, with everything at retail value, and most of the sets either being the from the summer or early year wave. However, my eyes were drawn to the Marvel cmf series box. My heart filled with elation. In the future I did plan on getting some Marvel cmf figures, so this would be a great victory for me. Moreover, if I buy the figures I want sparsely in time, then it won't seem like I'm spending as much, as £3.50 every couple of months is different to £14 in one go for 4 figures, for example.

As soon as I approached the box, my hands immediately grabbed hold of a bag and started to feel around. I know that these are Covid times, and I should be minimising my possible contact, but I couldn't resist. It was likely that other people had also ransacked the box beforehand anyway. There were not many bags left, and they were all piled up, and not arranged in order. I think there are supposed to be 3 sets of the series in each box (3*12), but I was unsure of my odds of getting a figure I wanted. I felt through each packet, being as thorough as I could, whist trying to picture what I was feeling, and how it related to a part or accessory of the minifig. Overall, I wasn't too successful with determining the figure, but I think I was alright at [mini]figuring out what it wasn't. The main figure I wanted to get was the zombie Captain America, so when feeling each packet, I compared it to the parts that would be in the packet I desired. Overall, I think I found the characters of 4 at the least of them, and I guess 1 at the very least, as I am 100% sure that one I guessed is the one I have in my possession. One time I felt a hair piece which was either Winter soldier or Falcon, but I couldn't find a shield. This also ruled out the zombie figure I wanted, as I knew there would be a shield and a helmet piece. The helmet for star lord was quite obvious, as it is quite cylindrical and large, and you couldn't really mix it up. I did at one time find the shield, which filled me with hope, but then I felt a piece which didn't add up. It felt like a hairpiece, and I am quite certain that that was the Captain Britain figure. For the penultimate figure, I could feel a strange flat object which was raised at the sides. I thought this was a part of falcon's wings, but that didn't seem right. The part which confirmed that the figure was white vision for me was a 2*1 tile piece. After I touched up the rest, and narrowed down just the one packet, I researched a picture of the series just to double check. Sure enough, the white Vision figure was the one one which came with a 2*1 tile piece. I also hypothesised that the flat bit was the little screen that came with it, but it turns out it was the laptop base. I could of course also feel the legs, torso and head, but that was in common with every single other figure.

I had selected my choice. Before I move on I should also mention that touching lego minifigure packets in the middle of tesco isn't the most relaxing experience. Although I couldn't see myself, I imagine that it was an interesting sight. I was also displaying my lanyard on my person, which would confirm my identity even more if I was spotted. Bystanders weren't the only worry though. I was constantly terrified of an employee walking past, at which point I would probably suddenly stop, and probably look very suspicious. There also would've been CCTV, which now permanently has me on tape. While fiddling around there is always the danger of being suspected of trying to steal, which wouldn't be the most favourable accusement.

After that, I made my way to pay. Everyone else was long gone by this point. When I got to a till, I scanned all my stuff, and prepared to pay. When I saw that it was over £5, I did feel a pang of gloom (but now we knew that Tesco was at fault). I did consider paying with my card, which I hadn't done yet, but then I remembered that I didn't remember my PIN. I think I know the numbers, just not what order they go in. [After checking just now, it turns out I do know my PIN, but now it occurs to me that I don't know which way up the card goes, or if it matters.] Not willing to try the different combinations at the card reader, I paid in cash, with a £5 note and 2 20ps. I expected to receive a 10p coin in return, but at my dismay all I got a pile of coppers, which is a bit frustrating. I guess the till was just being a dick to me today, as first the overpayment, and second the inconvenient change.

I then made my way back. It wasn't a very brisk journey, as I went a bit back and forth on the islands at the entrance to Tesco. I got impatient when waiting at the main island, as it seemed like I would be waiting a while, so I walked up to a podium a little bit back, which not only was further than I first thought, resulting with me just strolling down the middle of the road, but it was also very small. So there I was just stood on this tiny island with most the space taken up with a big bollard. I then waited longer than I would've had to at the other platform, until I could eventually cross the road. I thought I could walk up to the miner's statue to see if everyone was still there, which they were. I then ate one of my chocolate bars, which was very nice, and I would explain in more detail if it was the main subject. Sam demanded a piece, which I gave unreluctantly, although I could've eaten it myself. He also requested "Open up your lego", which until the last syllable I was very startled. Then came a time where they were required to return to HSFC, so I made my way home.


I was going to end it there, until I remembered what this review was actually about. This is already nearly 1.5 thousand words long, and I haven't even described what the review is about. But before I do that, I must describe the packaging. It is the standard cmf packet of now, being slightly taller than they were a few years ago. The material of the bag does seem less structurally stable than previous versions, as it seems to become more wrinkled, but if anything that would just make it easier to feel inside the bags. The layout is quite similar what it's always been, it's mostly gust a price increase that's different. However, with Lego overall becoming more expensive, and this also being a licensed theme, at least it hasn't become unreasonably expensive. £4 would definitely be pushing it, and £5 would just be ridiculous.

Upon opening the product, you are presented with an array of objects. A notable aspect is that the figure and components are now sealed in a little plastic bag, like the ones in full scale sets. The cape came outside the plastic though, which is quite intriguing. Usually Lego capes come inside little card boxes, but for the cmf series I guess they make and exception. The ticksheet that comes with it is now taped up, which like the separate plastic bag I'm not sure what it adds. Maybe it provides extra protection to the sheet? Also interesting was that upon opening, the orientation was landscape, which from my experience is quite unusual, as it is usually portrait. It does also look nice I guess, with the blue colour fade background and the grey Lego-ised comic border which is quite standard, but overall it is pretty standard.

Now, finally we are onto the figure. The character is from the famous franchise Marvel, which is a well-known and respected brand spanning comics, films, series, games and more. This cmf series was specifically based on the 2021 MCU series, which include 3 from Wandervision, 2 from Falcon and the Winter soldier, 2 from Loki and 5 from What if. This white vision is from the Wandervision series.

The printing on the mf is very detailed. Whilst cmfs are often more detailed than figures in sets, they aren't always fully detailed, as for example monica rambeau has unprinted black legs. However, this figure for one is very detailed. Starting with the head, the face is very good, and represents him very well. One inaccurate part however is how the stone space on his forehead is orange, despite it being blue in actuality. I can only imagine that it was a change with the concept art or info given to Lego. Even the back of the head is complete with printing. Moving down to the torso, it again is also intricate, with amazing printing on the front, back and arms. The same is the case with the legs, with leg, feet and even side leg printing. The legs are also dual moulded, which I find is quite significant. Another part connected to the main figure would be the cape. This is quite interesting, as it is a fabric cape, which I prefer to the old papery cape, but it is also a 4+ cape with only 1 hole, as opposed to the usual capes with 2 holes. I would guess that it is either that a 2 hole cape needs the box to keep it safe, or as it is likely younger kids will want some mfs, Lego needed to help cater to them. This would also be a reason for the printed pieces as well.
Quickfire comparison!!!: This is a new section, where I compare 2 things. I will now compare this White Vision figure, and the normal Vision figure, which is from the civil war/infinity war sets. The facial expression on white vision somehow looks even more emotionless, which evidently is true. The torso print on both is good, but the cmf has arm printing, whilst the set one doesn't. The set one is also lacking side leg printing, but I think it is very rare for that to happen. Dual moulding also probably could've been used on the original figure, with green and purple-red, but Lego like to cheap out when they can. The capes on both are also soft, but with the normal version having 2 holes.

Now we just have the accessories to review. First, the laptop. This mini build consists of 3 parts: A bottom book piece in white, a printed 2*1 blue trans tile, and a printed blue trans window flap thing. The book part was what I confused in my feeling, as with a flat bottom with raised ends, I thought it could be falcon, but then deduced it wasn't. The printed tile seems to just be a keyboard, whilst the window bit seems more interesting, with pictures related to the show, like a sword and a forcefield.
Finally, the stand. The base is standard for all cmfs, with a 3*4 size tile, with 4 studs centred in a line. This stand has been used since the start of Collectible Minifigure series, but for the marvel series (and was also used in other superhero series like the DC series), there are 2 extra pieces, one of which it a 2*1 tile with one stud. You put this on the base, and in the 2*1, you put a plastic translucent on top, which created an allusion of the character flying, which is quite a fun and interesting .


Overall, I am very happy with my figure. Whilst the figure I wanted (and still want) to get the most is one I didn't get, I still wanted to get this figure. Getting all the minifigs in the series would cost a lot of money, also I'm not interested in getting them all. After zombie Captain America (who does look cool with his dilapidated costume, and scratched shield (which I could use for the broken shield in Endgame)), Wanda and Winter soldier would be cool to get, but I already have the characters, just in a slightly different outfit.The same goes for spiderman, because although it is the highest quality and detail one we've got, I already have like 6 spiderman figures. Captain Britain comes in a costume very similar to a set I'll end up getting sometime. As for the other figures, I don't really mind about them, which does help my bank account. So in conclusion, the lego minifig is as good I expected to be, even better in fact, as the figure is just exemplary. However, the till screwed me over, which was not very trustworthy.
P.S. in addition, where I say "today", I mean Friday 8th October 2021, as it seems my review has overran to the next day. My review also overran my time and space estimation, as it is over 2.5 thousand words now. Let's see how many read mores that is [context: this was originally posted on Whatsapp]...
