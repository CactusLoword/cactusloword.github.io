Another song, another review. This song is by HaNaMiNa specifically. I did plan to write this review on Thursday or Friday, but I didn't have the creative spur to do so, which is imperitive to the writing process. I unfortunately couldn't write it on Tuesday (the release day), as I had to revise for Computing and Chemistry that night. I then had a special review planned for Wednesday (Cum: Standard Edition). To truly experience the song I was also awaiting a delivery of earphones, as my pair of the time only worked in one ear. Those earphones only lasted a month, hopefully these ones are higher quality, I splurged £10 on them.

I wasn't anticipating a new song at all that day. It was Tuesday 7th December 2021. I was just stood in the canteen queue, when I looked at my phone, and saw a notification for a new song. It was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. However, I had a maths mock later, so couldn't start a review right there and then, as I should probably do some last-minute revision. Nevertheless, I thought at the very least I could give the song a listen. After receiving my lunch (pasta and garlic bread, very nice), I walked up the road to eat. I also had an idea to put on the new song there, as there was no way I was listening to it inside. Also my earphones didn't work with my phone, as they were broken, so I decided not to bring them to school. Doing it there would provide me with a more secluded place to enjoy it. Despite this, when I got to the end of the road, I realised there wasn't wifi there, which was quite an oversight on my side. I also wasn't going to use mobile data, as I am with 3. Not that 3 is bad, as it is well suited to me, who rarely uses texts, phone calls and mobile signal. However, at times like this it disabled me, as it would be unwise to use up like £5 on a song.

After feasting, I made my way back to school, with a plan in mind. I could listen to the song in front of the school, allowing me to be in a secluded place, whilst leeching off the school wifi. I then proceeded to listen to the song just outside the school. I put my ear up to the speaker, so it probably looked like I was just on the phone, albeit a very one sided phone call, as I didn't speak once (although on my end that would be even weirder if I spoke). Anyway, after 2 mins and 39 secs, it had finished. My first thoughts were reasonably optimistic, but I did realise that I hadn't listened to it very well. Being outside, with cars driving by, meant there was an inconsistency with my hearing focus. Moreover, I think the speaker on my phone might be a bit broke, as it doesn't sound right. I also couldn't see the music video the whole time, as if I went to look then I couldn't listen properly.  It wasn't the optimal experience, but was fun for the first time. I would need to listen to it to a lot more anyway to review.

I then made my way up, and did some last maths before the exam. Then, after the exam (which I think went very well, and I am hopeful [I included that opinion out of interest for the future, as future me could either say "Yep, you guessed right! I am now the Worldwide appointed Mathmetician because of my superior maths skills", or "You really fucked up on that one Dylan. Neither maths nor Fortune Telling could be a good occupation for you"]), I had Computing and Chemistry revision to do. Again, this meant I couldn't do a review then, as I was busy with my educational reviews, but I still had a bit of time to listen to the song again, and in a quiet and solitary place as well. I also listened to all the HaNaMiNa songs whilst I revised, and then the whole Irodorimidori catalogue. One thing I find quite interesting is my change of opinion over the last week.

Tbh, a week ago I wasn't very fond of the song. To add to my findings, I listened to the rest of Irodorimidori. It was then that I realised that HaNaMiNa might be my least favourite band of the 3 in that universe.  I think I just thought they were quite similar to Irodorimidori, just being a bit rockier, and also apparently a bit worse. At this point I was probably in a different mood to today. This might be why I might think SSL is the best band, as all their songs are so unique and cool sounding. It has even been branded in my life, as it made my youtube music history, even though it was nearish the end of the year

Now, I have changed my mind. I honestly can't even think of any of the negatives of the song or band (except Minae of course, though I can't help enjoying her music). Maybe one reason for my lack of enjoyment was that I was tired after listening to the whole playlist. Sometimes, even though the songs are good, one's perception could be altered by time. And though I might not to admit it, as I don't want to insult the Irodorimidori universe, some of the songs are samey. This increases with the amount of music released by each band. This could also explain why SSL is my favourite band, as they have only 4 songs, which are each very unique. Maybe over time, their electronic sounds will become ordinary. Or not, only time will tell. It is a shame that SSL probably won't be in the anime though, as I think they came later on in the universe.




Anyway, that's enough rambling. Now I need to get onto reviewing the actual song itself. Only took 1000 words to get to it. Also from now I'm writing this a month later at 3am (Tues 28 Dec 2021).



The tune of the song is pretty good. I enjoy all of the singers' voices, so as usual the vocals were great. Nanase is the first to sing, and she sings the first verse, leading up to Nadeshiko (or Hana, can't tell). This transition works well, as we are slowly leading up to the chorus. There's a quiet little bit, and then the chorus. The chorus is very nice. Then there's a nice little guitar bit, until more verses, which have a backing of each line (by Minae by my guess), which sounds good. Quiet bit longer than last time, and the climaxing chorus. Guitar tune, end. So yeah, quite a good song. I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy it before.

The visuals are great as well. A theme of the music video appears to be blue diamonds, which matches to the song name, which suggests geometry and blue. Although, as explained later, I don't know what blueprints have to do with the song. The music video is quite bright and cheerful, which matches the message, which is one of optimism. One aspect which I don't usually take note of is the costume design, so I will here. The costumes are good. A theme between them all is fishnet clothing, which does make for a nice aesthetic. However, one thing which I have noticed just now, is that fishnets are made up of diamonds, which also relates to shapes and geometry and the music video and song name. That is a touch which I truly think is clever and appreciated. I'm also proud of myself for figuring out the hidden riddle, as even though it wasn't the first thing I thought when I saw the thumbnail of the song, I got there in the end.

Now onto the message of the song. There are no english lyrics, so google translate from the japanese lyrics on the wiki will have to do. It seems to be about moving forward in life, despite any setbacks. It talks about moving in one direction, and not turning back. Not sure what blueprints have to do with that though. There are also some nice bits about persevering regardless of the past, which is quite powerful. Here I'll quote the last few lines, which I quite like (translated by google)"

The lost time will not return

Even if this breath is cut off

Don't look back

Just go one way"



Along with some songs, a little story animation is released along side the music video, showing the background of the creation of the song, and also a snippet of the song itself. A new thing I thought I could do is do a little review on this. However, there aren't any english subs, which is a bit of a problem (I do hope there are subs for the anime), but I can do my best to decypher what is going on. It starts with Hana and Shirona (from Irodorimidori) bursting into Minae and Nadeshiko. They then go up to see Nanase, so it seems something is up. There is a bit of a sad moment with HaNaMiNa. Nanase then goes to see Serina, Aliciana and Nazuna, and they seem to introduce something which raises spirits. There's then a shot of Nanase with her guitar, and then the song runs. Tbh Nanase seems pretty cool. Then in the end credits there's SSL, which I'm not sure was about, it looked like a little teaser or something.



So yeah, a nice song and pretty music video about perseverance. Overall, pretty good. I'm still trying to think how I didn't like it at first. Also how I said HaNaMiNa was the worst band, as I think they are pretty great. Although SSL probably is my favourite, I do like all 3 of the bands in different ways, which is one thing I love about Irodorimidori.
