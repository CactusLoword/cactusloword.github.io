I am back, ready to review more pears. I took a short hiatus, which was probably shorter than it actually seemed, but that is of no matter, as I am here, for the time being at least. You may be wondering "What made you come back Dylan?". And to that I reply, a bad pear. I know it isn't a great moral that negativity made me return, but I guess it worked.

This pear was handed to me on Monday 29th Nov 2021. At first sight, I knew this would be an unusual experience. I'm not one to shame others for their sizes, but this was one dinky pear. I did take a picture of it, but do not be fooled; it looks deceptively big in the image. It is also an A4 piece of paper, but I'm not going to try to do any measurements from the picture.



I decided to eat it on Tuesday, at Lunchtime. I was given another pear then, so there goes the system I had before, where I would keep the new one and eat the previous one then. This method also ends up with me nearly always having a pear in my bag, which I'm not sure if that is a good or bad thing. Before consumption, I took a quick snap of it, which I hope no-one noticed, and then got ready to eat.

I hope you enjoyed that picture, along with some of my maths work.



The plan for this pear was to do another speedrun. It wouldn't be fair to compare this time with the other pear times, as this was a small one, but I thought it still could be fun, and interesting to see the time diff with a smaller pear. I could even introduce a new speedrun category: Stalkless 100% lightweight Pear speedrun. However, I ended up pausing the stopwatch after only 2 secs, but not because I had finished it. A whole pear in 2 seconds would be a tremendous achievement though. But no, it was a problem with the pear. Stay tuned to find out...



As soon as I took the first bite, I immediately had to unbite it. This pear was not ripe. 

I was left distraught. How could this happen? I expected to chomp my jaw into a sweet, succulent, juicy pear, and instead I got a hard knob. Just to check, I tried to bite a bit off the top, and whilst chewing, it was very crunchy and durable, which is not what a normal pear is like. I promptly consulted my dealer, as it had seemed I had been given a dodgy batch. He tried to convince me that that was normal, and what pears can be like. However, he could not fool me, as me smarter to beleif hism. This pear was harder than a horny Iron Golem (omgosh a MeinKraft reference! so epic so cool).

When I re-seated myself, I pondered for a bit, as I tried to eat the pear. Although it was not very pleasant, it would be a waste to not eat it, even if it is like biting a table (sorry about that comparison, it hurts my teeth just thinking about it). When eating, I was reminded of another crunchy food. This pear was just like eating a carrot. 



Whilst it still wasn't your average pear, in fact it was way below average (and not just in texture), it was still kind of interesting eating a Pear-carrot. The next pear might also be similar to this one, so we'll see if that is as tough as this pear. Moreover, in retrospect, this story does have a moral. Never judge a book by it's cover. Apparently the smaller ones are harder and the bigger ones are juicier. I guess in that way, no-one draws the short straw (or penis), as there are pros and cons to both sides. Smaller ones are harder but less pleasant, and bigger ones are juicier, but therefore harder to manage. In terms of pears of course. Wow, we sure can learn a lot from pears.
