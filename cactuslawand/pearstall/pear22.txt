We've had so many pear shapes. Long. Short. Chunky. But those were all abnormal shapes. What sets this apart is that it was the Perfect Pear shape.

When I received it (on Monday 13th December 2022), it was pure perfection. If you were to picture the best pear possible, this would be what you should think of. If you were to draw the perfect pear, it probably be a different story, but the intended outcome would be something resembling this pear. It is literally the pear emoji üçê.

However, from previous experience, it being in my bag wouldn't end well. But to my surprise, when I went to eat it, it was mostly unscathed. There was a small slit on the side, but overall it was pretty good. Despite that, it was it's destiny to be eaten. I couldn't keep it forever.

I did consider speedrunning it, but after the first couple of bites, I decided I would relax and enjoy it. Although I didn't consider it when I ate it, I think it might've been perfect on the inside. Maybe me not realising it whilst I enjoyed it means that it was truly perfect. I think it was just the right proportion with texture, juiciness and flavour.  It wasn't too chunky, but wasn't too soft. It was quite juicy, but it wasn't flooding everywhere (it did squirt on my face at one time, and leak on my hands, but it wasn't unpleasant). The flavour was also nice. At least, it wasn't noticeably bad, so I'm going to say it was perfect. 



So yeah, that was one great pear. By comparison, some might say this was the most perfect pear, which I will never experience again. However, I view all (most) pears as equal, and I can (usually) enjoy them.
