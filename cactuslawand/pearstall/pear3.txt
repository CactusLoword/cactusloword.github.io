Good evening my fellow nobility, today I will be reviewing the third of Sam's pears. Normally in my intro, I could hint at my opinion on the subject, however I will be unable to do that, due to this being a LIVE REVIEW! That's right, get hyped for this, it is a revolution in the reviewing profession. In the future, I might consider making it even more live, by posting a mini review for each bite shortly after I take it, but for now this is the format I will take.


Before I write down my thoughts live, I will first describe the circumstances that lead me to this point. I have previously consumed 2 of Sam's pears, of which one I have properly reviewed, and the other was briefly reviewed in the recently mentioned review. I was then offered another pear a day ago, on Monday 4th October 2021, at around shortly after the start of period 4. I was determined to review it, however it took me until today to sit down and write and eat this. 

I was also gifted another pear today, (the floor pear) but that will be saved for a review at a later date. They were both in my bag when I came home today, but don't worry; I could identify them both. I found that the one given yesterday was longer, whereas the one from today was chode-ier. I gave them both a little wash though anyway, just in case this was the unfortunate pear which took a fall. I then gently dried them, placing one in a fruit bowl (which could cause confusion from other members of the household, due to the pear-shaped fruit not being one that was purchased from the shopping. I then placed it on a plate, and took it to my judging station, to seal its fate.


First, I removed the stalk. Sadly, this was not as easy to remove as the one from my last pear, and when I pulled, It only removed half the stalk. This meant I had to try to pull out the rest, which was unnecessary effort.
On first impressions, the appearance does look quite good. The aesthetic of the top is good, having a nice green colour, with brown freckles. Lower down it doesn't look as good, as the green:brown ratio isn't as high as I would like it. Despite this, I am still eager to eat.

I take the first bite. It took some decisiveness to decide whether to start from the top or bottom, but I decided on the top. I bit the top of the longer bit clean off. The flavour isn't too strong, but is clearly tasting of pear. The texture of it isn't too great, as it feels to solid, or grainy, but I will see with the second bite. Whilst chewing, I also discovered that this might be a bit noisier than I anticipated, and with it being late at night, with half the household asleep, this might be a difficult situation to explain. However, I will persevere.

The second bite was just as big as the first, with all that's being left now is the round, plump, thicc bottom. This part had mostly the same taste, however I found the experience much more enjoyable, due to the texture being much more smoother. This would make sense, as there was more skin as a proportion to the inside than this chomp.

The third one was more or less similar to the second, but I think we are getting to the more juicy part.

For the fourth time, I ripped a big chunk out the side, and immediately enjoyed it. This is what I came for; here is where the skin is less prevalent, and the juicier (as juicy as you can get with a pear) and better texture part is. I could also describe the appearance of the inside, but there's not much to say, it's just the white-ish weird kind of fluffy-crunchy solid middle bit.

With the fifth mastication (synonym for chewing), it was mostly like the fourth, as it was the same on the other side. This one was a bit softer though, which I quite liked.

The sixth is getting closer to the bottom, so there is a bit more skin, making the texture more chewy. However, as opposed to at the top, it is also juicy down here.

Seventh: same as last, more skin

With the eighth munch, I took a risk, and bit off the bottom bit, with the weird kind of end bit. Knowing this would not be a very nice part, I decided to eat it before, to save the better parts 'til last. Therefore, this bit wasn't as good, as there were the leaf bits.

The ninth bite also wasn't too great, as this was in the middle. This part was a bit stalky and stringy, and also tasted more sour maybe, I'm not sure how to explain tastes so well. If I had to explain it I would say it is like a higher pitch than the taste of the rest of the pear, but that probably didn't make sense. However, after this sacrifice I made, this means I can finish the rest as the nice part.

This was the penultimate gnaw, and was good. It was quite similar to the ones around 4 and 5, before I got too low.

And there we go, with one fatal action, I devoured the rest. This bite was a good one to end with, as it actually (as a guess) seemed like the average of all the other bites.


Overall, this was a pretty nice pear. In total, it took 11 bites to finish. If I could choose a favourite bite, I would pick the fifth, as it had the best taste, juiciness, texture and softness, all combined.
So there we go, this marks the end of the live review of this phallic fruit I just consumed. It was set out a bit differently to a normal review, and the experience was different, but I think it worked quite well, and it was a different and enjoyable time. I would say more about the format, but then that would be starting another review, which it is not the time for. I would say goodnight, but I need to brush my teeth first, and I've still got a pear taste in my mouth, and the combination of fruit and toothpaste doesn't go too well. Bye! [Wait, how do you stop this live thing? Do you click this, or here? Oh right, maybe if I press this, then I think it might stop the-]
