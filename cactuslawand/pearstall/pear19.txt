After the last pear, I was dreading and  anticipating this pear. Dreading, as it could be another hard chunky pear. Anticipating, as I still had a sliver of hope this would be a good pear. I guess I'd just have to take a dive, to see if it was another carrot pear.

It wasn't that hard. Don't get me wrong; there was still a remnant of hardness, like a deflating penis after orgasm, but it wasn't as hard as yesterday. It was juicier, which was especially good, as the last one was just kind of bad.

One concerning thing however is that I may have injected ink. Due to an abundance of pears in my bag, some of them were got a bit bashed. As a result, I wrapped this pear in kitchen paper, to help protect it. However, some time after eating the pear, I checked the kitchen paper, and there was an ink stain on there. Oh well.

Overall, this pear was pretty good. Not the best pear, but that's alright, I enjoyed it anyway.
