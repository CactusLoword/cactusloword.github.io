Here I review the Irodorimidori anime, which first aired on Tuesday 4th January 2022. Originally the first 3 reviews were in my main irodorimidori story, but I decided to separate them, so this is anime based and the other one is music based.

Here is a link to the playlist on youtube. They aren't subbed, so you would have to find subbed versions elsewhere. Also at this time they only have the first and most recent episode up, and all the others are deleted. Lets hope that doesn't continue into the future.

If you have been inspired by Irodorimidori, and seek out the music, here is a channel I made with organised playlists (the videos themselves are still hosted on the Irodorimidori channel):
